#summary Specification of the structure of the preprocessed files.
==Preprocessed file format==
Specification of the structure of the preprocessed files in EBNF(almost).

Notes:
Address numbers in the file refer to a byte-offset into the file.
Count numbers indicate the number of the following elements that can be read
Function numbers refer to a function numbered in the order they occur in the function_addresses list. Numbering starts from 0.
Invocation numbers refer to an invocation of a function in the order they occur in the invocations list. Numbering starts from 0.
